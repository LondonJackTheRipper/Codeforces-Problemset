# Competitive problemset
A collection of solved problems in every competive programming-style platform.

Hi, a little bit about my self, up to 2024, im currently 16 years old, i'm a vietnamese people with a strong passion about detective stories (my most favourite ones is **Sherlock Holmes**).

## Why this project ?
The aim of this project is to save all problems that i've solved during the period of training for competitive programming.

This way, i will never concern about losing all the source codes of my problems. Also, i can revise these problems to sharpen my knowledge.

**Github** is a perfect place for not only myself but also you guys as you can also read my source code to.

Having any questions about my code ? -> go DM me
